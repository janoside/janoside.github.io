# Salmon Croquettes 

* 1 14.75 oz can pink salmon
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup chopped onion
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons yellow corn meal
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Pour all of the ingredients into a large bowl and mix them. A large spoon or a potato masher works just fine. I add the flour last because I sometimes adust the amount to control the consistency. Mold the dough-like mix that you end up with into patties (like thick homemade hamburgers).

Coat a cast iron frying pan with a little cooking oil or Crisco. Preheat the oiled pan over medium heat. Slip the patties into the pan, fitting as many as you can but leaving room to turn them. Cook until medium brown on one side, then turn over and do the same to the other side.
